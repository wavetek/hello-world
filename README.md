# hello-world

Hello Github!

I'm an aspiring Data Analyst here to develop skills and network.
My main interests are learning SQL, Tableau, Python, as well as exploring quantitative analysis, data mining, and presentation techniques.
I come from a retail background, however I am enthusiastic and deeply curious about:  fintech/blockchain technology, real estate, government and city data, and the travel industry.

Currently based in Seattle, WA.
