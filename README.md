# hello-world

Hello Github!

I'm a Business Analyst here to develop skills and network.

My main interests are in Analytics and Data Science, including SQL, Tableau, and Python.

I come from a retail background, however I'm also enthusiastic and deeply curious about:  blockchain technology, decentralized systems, and internet 3.0.

Currently based in Seattle, WA.
